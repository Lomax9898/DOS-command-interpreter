To run the program simply put the file in a linux environment like WSL and compile.
From there you should be able to use cd, dir, type, del, ren, and copy DOS commands in the place of 
UNIX commands cd, ls, cat, rm, mv, and cp. It will continue to loop until Ctrl-C is pressed.
The program dosen't check for flags and the error checking only check for correct amount of arguments.
